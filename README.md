# all.c
all-c is a complicated formula to find P(n+1) for any N-memberd array.

here's how it works:

consider this set: p={1,4,9,16};

first dept -- f, will be {3,5,7}

second dept -- s, is {2,2} where all members are equal -- like Soviet Unions --. thus the nth term is p[n] = p[0] + (n - 1) * f[0] + (n - 1) * (n - 2) * s[0] * 0.5

it usually works, cause there are some other formulas as well.

# all.py
all-py is not the same.
