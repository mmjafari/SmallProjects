# all.c
all-c is a complicated formula to find P(n+1) for any N-memberd array.
here's how it works:

consider this set:

1    4    9    25

as in second depth, we will have:

  3    5    7

as in third depth, it will become:

    2    2

now, you can consider p(n) as p(n) 
# all.py
all-py is not the same.
